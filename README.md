```
GLASS WALLS

Glass walls;
  They were built
// To keep us out,
The beauty that lay
Beholden within
Unscalable to the
Many who were
deemed unworthy
To scale its walls
As plebians.
Yet scaling the walls
__patiently,
I've found
  Glass walls to be
Glass barriers indeed,
By yours truly
  Destined those that
Fail to
// Do and dream.
